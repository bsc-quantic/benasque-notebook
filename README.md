## Benasque Spring School on Near-Term Quantum Computing
### Quantum Circuit simulation with Tensor Networks

This repository contains the code for the Tensor Network Workshop for the Benasque Spring School on Near-Term Quantum Computing. In this workshop, we will learn how to simulate quantum circuits using tensor networks.

The `notebook.ipynb` file contains the notebook that we will use during the workshop. The `notebook-solutions.ipynb` file contains the solutions to the exercises. The `slides.pdf` file contains the slides that we will use during the workshop.
